# Human Body Pose Estimation System

### Problem Statement
Young adults spending extended hours at desks face increased risk of musculoskeletal issues due to poor posture during regular activities (sitting, working, reading, walking).

### Solution
Developed a real-time pose detection system using computer vision and machine learning to monitor human postures and trigger alerts when irregular patterns are detected.
Key Features
- Real-time posture tracking during multiple activities
- Pattern recognition for irregular posture detection
- Alert mechanism for corrective intervention
- User testing validation framework

### Technologies Used
Computer vision algorithms, machine learning models, pose estimation libraries

### My Role
Designed the pose detection algorithm, implemented the alert mechanism, conducted user testing cycles, and validated system effectiveness with real users.

### Outcome
Successfully demonstrated preventive healthcare through continuous monitoring. Research paper submitted to the International Conference on Soft Computing & Signal Processing (currently under review).

### Key Takeaway
This project reinforced my interest in building user-centric solutions where understanding behavior patterns and creating timely interventions drive impactâ€”principles that later became foundational to my product management approach in educational technology.
